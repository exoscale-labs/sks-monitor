# Deploying Monitoring Stack on Exoscale using Terraform / Helm

Monitoring is crucial to measure the performance of applications running in a production environment. 
This Terraform / Helm project allows you to deploy a monitoring stack composed of two popular open-source tools: Prometheus and Grafana.

##### Useful commands :
- Terraform init
- Terraform validate
- Terraform plan --out  terraform.plan
- Terraform apply "terraform.plan"
- Terraform destroy

## Monitoring Stack

### Node exporter 

Node exporter is responsible for fetching the statistics from various hardware and virtual resources in the format which Prometheus can understand and with the help of the prometheus server those statistics can be exposed on portÂ 9100.
### Prometheus 

Prometheus is an open-source tool for scrapping the performance metrics of any given hardware resource (CPU, VM, Cloud Virtual Machine, Router, etc.).
The architecture is really scalable and 3rd party libraries makes it more powerful.

### Grafana 

 Grafana is an open-source analytics and visualization tool for viewing the metrics scraped by Prometheus from various resources. 
Grafana does not store any data, but instead, it relies on Prometheus to send the data so that dashboard can be prepared.

## Improvements for Production environments

- CI/CD pipelines:  For further agility and flexibility.
